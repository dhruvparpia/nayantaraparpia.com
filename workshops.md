This is typically a 5-day workshop especially designed for adults who need not have experience in any other dance form but are interested in learning Kathak and understanding more about Indian classical dance. Participants are introduced to the basics in Kathak technique and are also taught a little about other Indian classical dance styles. The highlights of these sessions include yoga for warming up and cooling down, rhythmic footwork, hand movements and pirouettes, technical compositions set to a rhythm cycle, story-telling through gestures and facial expressions, understanding and appreciating classical dance, and relevant theory that helps provide a strong foundation. 

#### 2.	“Strengthening the foundation”

This is a 3-5 day workshop designed for Kathak students with more than 5 years of training in Kathak. The essence of this workshop is to introduce participants to techniques of strengthening and improving their basics, something that every dancer, no matter how advanced, needs to consistently work on and maintain in order to be strong performers and teachers. The highlights of this workshop include yoga for warming up and cooling down, various exercises to increase speed, stamina and precision in footwork, understanding clarity in line and movement based on the ‘body grid’, and voice modulation for impactful ‘padhant’.   They are also taught some compositions in Teentaal that apply these very techniques.
