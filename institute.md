#### Institute Vision

Nayantara founded the 'Tridhaara Institute of Kathak' where she runs regular classes in pure classical Kathak at her studio in Viman Nagar, Pune. Having a strong technical foundation and a deep passion for teaching with over 13 years of experience, Nayantara has always strived to carry forward the tradition of Indian classical dance in its purest form, with immense discipline, yet with innovative methods to engage the new generation of students.

The aim of the institute is not only to impart training in the practical aspects of Kathak, but also to ensure that each student has a thorough knowledge of the theory behind everything they learn. In addition to this, Nayantara also stresses on the importance of yoga and Hindustani classical music from the very beginning. *The confluence of these three streams - Kathak, Yoga and Music - forms the essence of the name 'Tridhaara'*.

Hugely inspired by the teachings of senior gurus and artists, Nayantara also believes that as part of dance training, young practitioners should also be exposed to allied forms of art and well-being, such as painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, poetry, literature, fitness and nutrition. To facilitate this, she invites professionals in those fields to conduct interactive workshops with her students from time to time, thus providing a truly holistic arts education, the first of its kind in Pune.

Nayantara also trains her students for annual showcases, competitions and stage performances for cultural events.
